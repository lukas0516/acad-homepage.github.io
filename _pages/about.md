I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Nanjing University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Liangmo Wang. I am also a visiting Ph.D. student in the [Energy Storage Lab](https://ziyousongthu.wixsite.com/website), led by [Prof. Ziyou Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CWEeVz4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works).
Feel free to contact me (wangqun@njust.edu.cn) if you are interested in my work.
